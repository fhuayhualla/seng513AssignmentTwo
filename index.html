                <p>The game will start by informing player 1 that it is his/her turn to play. This player will then input a number 1-9 such that 1 represents square (0, 0), 2 represents square (0, 1), up until square 9 (2, 2). Next, the game will inform player two that it is his/her turn to play. The game loops with this process up until the game ends with a win for player 1, a win for player 2, or a draw.</p>
